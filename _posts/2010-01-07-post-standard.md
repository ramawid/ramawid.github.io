### Picking a corpus & general research

I chose using 3 different prompts regarding women in chatGPT. My three prompts circulated around women in different persepectives, body positivity, women in STEM, and the #MeToo movement.

**Prompt I:** Explore the underrepresentation of women in STEM in an essay format.

**Prompt II:** Write an essay that explores the impact of societal beauty standards on women's self-esteem and mental health.

**Prompt III:** Explore the rise of momentum in 2017 with the #MeToo hashtag on social media in an essay.

For the first essay the title given was _"Bridging the Gender Gap: The Underrepresentation of Women in STEM."_ Generally 
the topic of women in STEM revolves around the representation, challenges, and advancements of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. It encompasses efforts to address gender disparities, promote diversity and inclusion, and create opportunities for women to thrive in these traditionally male-dominated fields. The concept underscores the importance of equal access to education, supportive environments, and initiatives aimed at breaking down barriers and stereotypes to achieve gender equality in STEM.

The second essay titled : _"The Weight of Beauty: Exploring Societal Standards and Women's Well-Being"._ The topic of societal beauty standards on women examines the cultural norms and expectations regarding women's appearance, often focusing on physical attributes such as body shape, skin tone, and facial features. These standards are influenced by various factors including media, advertising, cultural traditions, and historical ideals of beauty. The concept highlights how these standards can impact women's self-esteem, body image, and mental health, leading to issues like body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Efforts to challenge and redefine beauty standards involve promoting diversity, body positivity, and inclusivity, encouraging acceptance of different body types and appearances.

The third essay, _"Unveiling the Momentum: The Rise of #MeToo in 2017"_, originating in 2017, highlighted the widespread prevalence of sexual harassment and assault, empowering survivors to share their experiences and hold perpetrators accountable, while sparking a global conversation about gender-based violence and the need for cultural and systemic change.

### Corpus Analysis
I used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to juxtapose three texts concerning women—specifically addressing women's participation in STEM, the promotion of body positivity, and the advocacy within the #MeToo movement—yielded an unexpected outcome. Despite the common theme of women, the analysis revealed a notable scarcity of shared words and phrases among these texts. This finding underscores the divergent nature of discourses surrounding women's experiences across different spheres of societal engagement.

I anticipated a degree of lexical overlap, given the focus on gender-related narratives. The discourse on women in STEM may emphasize professional empowerment and gender equity within technical fields, employing terminology specific to academia and technology. On the other hands, discussions pertaining to body positivity might foreground concepts related to self-image, acceptance, and societal beauty standards, utilizing language reflective of personal narratives and societal critique.

Similarly, the discourse surrounding the #MeToo movement encompassed narratives of trauma, power dynamics, and systemic change, drawing upon legal and sociopolitical terminology. These diverse linguistic patterns indicate not only the multifaceted nature of women's experiences but also the varied approaches and priorities within feminist discourse.

In essence, the Voyant Tools analysis underscores the necessity of nuanced examination when exploring gender-related narratives. Such an approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous landscape of feminist discourse, recognizing the multiplicity of voices, concerns, and objectives within the broader framework of women's rights and empowerment.

Through doing this analysis I finalized that computer-assisted analysis offers a faster and more systematic approach to examining larger bodies of text, providing insights that may not be readily apparent through traditional linear reading. Personally I would use this for larger files, not articles or shorter essays as the data might not be as accurate. In terms of visualization of textual data, I thought it was extremely useful as it allowed me to gain a deeper look on the text. Combined with my background information on all 3 topics, the takeaways were sufficent in terms of time. While a linear read of each text is theoretically possible, it may be impractical within a given timeframe, making computer-assisted analysis a valuable tool for efficiently extracting meaningful insights from large text corpora.

### Conclusion
Your conclusion offers a comprehensive overview of the analysis conducted using Voyant Tools, highlighting the diverse nature of discourse surrounding women's experiences across different spheres. You effectively demonstrate how the three prompts, despite all focusing on women, yield distinct narratives and linguistic patterns when analyzed computationally.

Your recognition of the importance of nuanced examination in understanding gender-related narratives adds depth to your conclusion. By acknowledging the multiplicity of voices and concerns within feminist discourse, you underscore the complexity of women's experiences and the varied approaches to addressing gender inequality.

Additionally, your reflection on the utility of computer-assisted analysis provides valuable insights into its benefits and limitations. You emphasize its efficiency in processing large bodies of text and extracting meaningful insights, while also acknowledging the importance of context and the potential limitations of the data accuracy.

Overall, your conclusion effectively synthesizes the findings of the analysis while offering thoughtful reflections on the significance of computational tools in examining complex social issues.
