**Part One**

For our first assignment, I checked out pieces from The Bauhaus collection found on the Harvard Art Museum website and compared them with the information in the CSV file. By doing this, I wanted to see how much detail and context each platform gives. It helps us understand the pros and cons of using digital tools and data to organize art.
 	As I scrolled through the Bauhaus collection I was intrigued by Feininger's 1915 painting "Avenue of Trees" which marks his transition from figurative to cubism-inspired art, influenced by Picasso and Braque, exhibited in Berlin in 1917. By 1919 at the Bauhaus, his work became increasingly abstract, featuring minimal human figures. I found the website interface to be very user friendly, I had a positive experience overall and was able to extract a good amount of information and understanding for the pieces I chose such as the artist's name, title of the artwork, year of creation, medium, dimensions, and perhaps a brief description or historical context. From this metadata, I could provide insights or summaries about the artworks, discuss their significance, the artistic movements they belong to, or the techniques used by the artist.	
However, the CSV file offered additional data fields or more extensive information about the artworks as a whole or as part of something larger rather than an individualized piece. Having access to such comprehensive data could facilitate deeper research and analysis of the art pieces.
Moreover, a CSV file might allow for more efficient data manipulation and analysis using programming languages or statistical software compared to a web-based interface, which typically provides a more user-friendly but less flexible interaction experience. Therefore, while the web interface may be suitable for browsing and exploring artworks, accessing the CSV file could enable more advanced data processing and research capabilities.

**Part Two**

The dataset includes a vast array of cultures and regions, ranging from well-known civilizations like Egyptian, Greek, and Roman, to less common ones like Aztec, Kushite, and Seleucid. This wide representation suggests an effort to encompass diverse cultural heritages.
Diversity Across Time Periods: The data includes objects from a wide range of time periods, including ancient civilizations like Sumerian, Babylonian, and Mycenaean, as well as more recent cultures like Ottoman, Mughal, and Colonial Spanish. This indicates a commitment to showcasing human history across different epochs.
Global Scope: Objects from various continents are present, including Africa (e.g., Ethiopian, West African), Asia (e.g., East Asian, Indian, Persian), Europe (e.g., English, French, Italian), North America (e.g., Native American), and South America (e.g., Colombian, Peruvian). This global representation reflects a broad perspective on world cultures.
Inclusive Approach: While some cultures have a higher object count than others (e.g., American, European), the presence of even less represented cultures (e.g., Turkmen, Slovakian) suggests an effort towards inclusivity and a desire to highlight the diversity of human civilization.
Depth of Collection: The dataset shows a significant number of objects associated with certain cultures (e.g., 9844 objects classified as Byzantine, 35600 as German, 26040 as French), indicating both a focus on specific cultural areas and possibly the museum's collection strengths.
Based on these observations, it's evident that the contemporary US museum indeed embraces a diverse and inclusive view of the world, as indicated by the broad representation of cultures, regions, time periods, and the depth of the collection across various civilizations.
 
 With a focus on Armenian Culture I compared two pieces, one that is highly viewed, the other almost not at all. The first "One Tram?", two coins with intricate symbols portraying some sort of histroy. The other Liturgical Vestment (fragment), a textile art piece, which is a silk brocade with vibrant colors and imagery has been viewed again and again. This is my take on why is one favored while the other is not, although they are both in the same meusum under the same culture:

 Cultural Significance and Interest: Being of a religious and cultural significance, Liturgical Vestment fragment is reported to attract more attention. Christ depiction plus Tetramorph (which are symbols of the four evangelists) are significant in terms of interested people in Armenian religion art and Armenian history. It can also catch the interest of scholars studying Christian iconography or Armenian culture. However, “One Tram” coins though historically important may lack a broad-based audience’s fascination with it. On the other side, when compared with its symbolism and relevance in our culture a majority of viewers might not find its images on the coins as excitingly attractive.

Aesthetic Appeal and Complexity: There could be higher number of those who have been attracted by the Liturgical Vestment fragment’s intricacy and beautiful colors which make this item visually appealing for many individuals. The presence of figures as well as various symbols is likely to arouse curiosity or admiration for the level of work done on them by artists. Conversely, the design may look plain on “One Tram” coins hence they fail to catch one’s eye or evoke such appreciation for beauty at once.

Acessibility and Description: The level of detail given in the object descriptions can also determine viewer interest. In contrast, the description of a fragment of a liturgical vestment can provide more context and insights into its symbols and history which would further attract viewers. However, the “One Tram” coins are introduced in few words without any background or explanation that may ring true to those who have no previous knowledge about Armenian numismatics or history.

Online Visibility and Promotion: There are several things which can determine if certain objects will be visible on the site: their presence in special exhibitions or educational resources, prominence on the website and how much they are being promoted using social media among others. Therefore, if online platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. pay more attention to them by making sure that Liturgical Vestment Fragment is highlighted or share widely it may record more viewership than “One Tram” coins.
