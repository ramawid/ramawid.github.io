Part One
For our first assignment, I checked out pieces from The Bauhaus collection found on the Harvard Art Museum website and compared them with the information in the CSV file. By doing this, I wanted to see how much detail and context each platform gives. It helps us understand the pros and cons of using digital tools and data to organize art.
 	As I scrolled through the Bauhaus collection I was intrigued by Feininger's 1915 painting "Avenue of Trees" which marks his transition from figurative to cubism-inspired art, influenced by Picasso and Braque, exhibited in Berlin in 1917. By 1919 at the Bauhaus, his work became increasingly abstract, featuring minimal human figures. I found the website interface to be very user friendly, I had a positive experience overall and was able to extract a good amount of information and understanding for the pieces I chose such as the artist's name, title of the artwork, year of creation, medium, dimensions, and perhaps a brief description or historical context. From this metadata, I could provide insights or summaries about the artworks, discuss their significance, the artistic movements they belong to, or the techniques used by the artist.	
However, the CSV file offered additional data fields or more extensive information about the artworks as a whole or as part of something larger rather than an individualized piece. Having access to such comprehensive data could facilitate deeper research and analysis of the art pieces.
Moreover, a CSV file might allow for more efficient data manipulation and analysis using programming languages or statistical software compared to a web-based interface, which typically provides a more user-friendly but less flexible interaction experience. Therefore, while the web interface may be suitable for browsing and exploring artworks, accessing the CSV file could enable more advanced data processing and research capabilities.
