# "Assignment #3: Spatial Data"

### Choosing a Source

The source I used is the Kazakhstan Defense Enterprise Directory about various enterprises, likely sourced from documents such as company profiles, directories, or databases related to industrial activities in Kazakhstan. 

The data provided includes enterprise names, alternate names, addresses, telephone numbers, general overviews of the enterprises, primary businesses, ownership details, and sometimes additional information such as military product lines, conversion projects, principal officers, and civil product lines. The data was somewhat clear and easy to gather and identify. However, it required parsing and organizing the information into a structured format suitable for tabular presentation.

###  Modeling the data. 
To automate the extraction of information I used ChatGPT, I created a prompt that specifies the type of information to extract, such as enterprise names, addresses, and telephone. There was a good amount of data so I had to work in chunks. Most of the adresses were provided but a couple were missing or not trackable probably due to changed streets names or areas and neighbourhoods.


Here is a picture showing the sheet I created using the data the locations on the map:

### Takeaways

For this assignment, an ideal source would be a structured database or directory of enterprises in Kazakhstan, containing standardized information such as enterprise names, addresses, contact details, industry classifications, and other relevant data fields. This would facilitate easier extraction and analysis of information compared to unstructured text.
