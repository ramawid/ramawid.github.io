### Part I: Picking a corpus & general research

I chose using 3 different prompts regarding women in chatGPT. My three prompts circulated around women in different persepectives, body positivity, women in STEM, and the #MeToo movement.

**Prompt I:** Explore the underrepresentation of women in STEM in an essay format

**Prompt II:** Write an essay that explores the impact of societal beauty standards on women's self-esteem and mental health

**Prompt III:** Explore the rise of momentum in 2017 with the #MeToo hashtag on social media in an essay.

For the first essay the title given was _"Bridging the Gender Gap: The Underrepresentation of Women in STEM."_ Generally 
the topic of women in STEM revolves around the representation, challenges, and advancements of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. It encompasses efforts to address gender disparities, promote diversity and inclusion, and create opportunities for women to thrive in these traditionally male-dominated fields. The concept underscores the importance of equal access to education, supportive environments, and initiatives aimed at breaking down barriers and stereotypes to achieve gender equality in STEM.

The second essay titled : _"The Weight of Beauty: Exploring Societal Standards and Women's Well-Being"._ The topic of societal beauty standards on women examines the cultural norms and expectations regarding women's appearance, often focusing on physical attributes such as body shape, skin tone, and facial features. These standards are influenced by various factors including media, advertising, cultural traditions, and historical ideals of beauty. The concept highlights how these standards can impact women's self-esteem, body image, and mental health, leading to issues like body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Efforts to challenge and redefine beauty standards involve promoting diversity, body positivity, and inclusivity, encouraging acceptance of different body types and appearances.

The third essay, _"Unveiling the Momentum: The Rise of #MeToo in 2017"_, originating in 2017, highlighted the widespread prevalence of sexual harassment and assault, empowering survivors to share their experiences and hold perpetrators accountable, while sparking a global conversation about gender-based violence and the need for cultural and systemic change.

### Part II: Corpus Analysis
I used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to juxtapose three texts concerning women—specifically addressing women's participation in STEM, the promotion of body positivity, and the advocacy within the #MeToo movement—yielded an unexpected outcome. Despite the common theme of women, the analysis revealed a notable scarcity of shared words and phrases among these texts. This finding underscores the divergent nature of discourses surrounding women's experiences across different spheres of societal engagement.

I anticipated a degree of lexical overlap, given the focus on gender-related narratives. The discourse on women in STEM may emphasize professional empowerment and gender equity within technical fields, employing terminology specific to academia and technology. On the other hands, discussions pertaining to body positivity might foreground concepts related to self-image, acceptance, and societal beauty standards, utilizing language reflective of personal narratives and societal critique.

Similarly, the discourse surrounding the #MeToo movement encompassed narratives of trauma, power dynamics, and systemic change, drawing upon legal and sociopolitical terminology. These diverse linguistic patterns indicate not only the multifaceted nature of women's experiences but also the varied approaches and priorities within feminist discourse.

In essence, the Voyant Tools analysis underscores the necessity of nuanced examination when exploring gender-related narratives. Such an approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous landscape of feminist discourse, recognizing the multiplicity of voices, concerns, and objectives within the broader framework of women's rights and empowerment.

Through doing this analysis I finalized that computer-assisted analysis offers a faster and more systematic approach to examining larger bodies of text, providing insights that may not be readily apparent through traditional linear reading. Personally I would use this for larger files, not articles or shorter essays as the data might not be as accurate. In terms of visualization of textual data, I thought it was extremely useful as it allowed me to gain a deeper look on the text. Combined with my background information on all 3 topics, the takeaways were sufficent in terms of time. While a linear read of each text is theoretically possible, it may be impractical within a given timeframe, making computer-assisted analysis a valuable tool for efficiently extracting meaningful insights from large text corpora.

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.

Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.

Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.
